I have developed a music application that retrieves data from the iTunes API. The application features several albums on its main page. Users can select an album from there and view and listen to the songs within the album. On the search screen, users can search for their desired songs and listen to 30-second song previews or watch music videos if available. They can also add their favorite songs to their favorites list and view them on the favorites screen.After a user performs a search, they can see the songs from their last search on the main screen when they return to it. These songs will continue to appear on the main screen as long as the user does not delete the application. This allows users to easily access and revisit their recently searched songs without the need to perform the search again.

# Usage
1. Launch the app on your mobile device.
2. If there is no internet connection, an alert will be displayed, and certain features may be limited.
3. On the home screen, you will see a selection of albums to choose from.
4. Tap on an album to view its details and see the list of songs.
5. To listen to a song, tap on the song title to start playing it.
6. If available, you can also watch the music video of a song by tapping on the corresponding button.
7. To search for a specific song, go to the search screen and enter the desired song title or artist name in the search bar.
8. Tap the search button to display the search results.
9. From the search results, you can listen to a 30-second preview of the song or view additional information about it.
10. If you find a song you like, you can add it to your favorites by tapping the "Add to Favorites" button.
11. Access your favorite songs by navigating to the favorites screen, where you can see the list of songs you have added.
12. Returning to the home screen after performing a search will display the songs from your last search, allowing you to easily revisit them.
